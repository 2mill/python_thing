# The purpose of this program is to be able to map a patch panel based off the information from the CSV file earlier.
# A standard patch panel that I know of has 48 ports. Therefore, it will be an array of size 48 each containig a reference to the Terminal object that has the correct information

# class PatchPanel:
# 	def __init__(self, patch_panel_number: int, location:str) -> None:
# 		self.ports = [None] * 48
# 		print(self.ports)

# PatchPanel(7, "pullen")
